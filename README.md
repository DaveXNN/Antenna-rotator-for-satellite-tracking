# Antenna rotator for satellite tracking
This repository contains Antenna rotator for satellite tracking project description. The goal of this project was to design a homemade antenna rotator for tracking any of the satellites in the Earth orbit. The rotator is controlled from a laptop via WiFi. The rotator controll unit is Raspberry Pi 4 with installed Mosquitto broker for subscribing data about satellites from the laptop. Raspberry Pi then controls stepper motors to turn two Yagi antennas into the right direction to the passing satellite. The source code on laptop and on Raspberry Pi is writen in Python 3.9.

## Introduction

Each satellite has data about its position in the Earth orbit called TLE (Two-Line Element). They are updated every 2 hours on URL: https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?GROUP=ACTIVE&FORMAT=tle. This rotator uses the latest TLE data to predict satellite visibility in a specific location on the Earth. For satellite visibility prediction is used python beyond library (https://pypi.org/project/beyond/). Here is an example of TLE for International Space Station and satellite Nexus FO-99:

```

```

If we have the latest TLE data, we can track each satellite in the Earth orbit. This rotator is designed primarily for tracking satellites in the low Earth orbit (LEO), it means below an altitude of 2 000 km.

For the next sections we need to define two important variables - azimuth and elevation of a satellite. Azimuth and Elevation are measures used to identify the position of a satellite flying overhead. Azimuth tells you what direction to face and elevation tells you how high up in the sky to look. Both are measured in degrees. Azimuth varies from 0째 to 360째 and elevation from 0째 to 90째.

## Hardware

The whole rotator is controlled by computer [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) via digital GPIO pins. Raspberry Pi is connected with two stepper motor drivers, two rotary encoders and a magnetometer.

The rotator has to follow satellite's azimuth and elevation, so we need two stepper motors and two drivers. Here is a list of electronic components:
